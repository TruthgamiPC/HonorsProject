# Summary

- Soldering didn't go too well in the QMB so ordering kit for home
- Camera seems simple to operate through python with the picamera library and can be pushed into a function of a class
- will follow up by testing camera commands more and try to finish the full function by trying to call from a custom interface


- Display will be tested when soldering is complete
- Small Concerns to how the UI will look
